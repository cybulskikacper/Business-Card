  ### What I learned

  This challenge took me definitely too long. I struggled with my poor CSS knowledge (Flexbox, positions). This challenge taught me that I should stop taking breaks from coding and focus on my goal seriously and revise my CSS knowledge. 

I learned how to work with Figma files as a Frontend Dev. I  also learned how to style using React.
